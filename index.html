                <h2>A LITTLE ABOUT ME ...</h2>
                <p><b>Hello,</b></p>
                <p>
                    My name is Gaurav (GAW-rav). I am a <b>Software Engineer</b> at <a href="http://www.synacor.com"><b>Synacor Inc.</b></a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have completed my <b>Master's</b> degree in <b>Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence)</b> and <b>Bachelor's</b> degree in <b>Computer Engineering</b>. I also like experimenting with and learning new things in the fields of  <b>Search algorithms</b>, <b>Machine Learning</b> <b>Big Data</b> and <b> Web frameworks</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like taking online courses at various MOOCs and learning technologies I like which helps me be a better developer. Currently, I am learning more about <b>Apache Spark</b> , <b>Python-based frameworkss</b> and <b>Unix shell scripting</b> I also participate in coding competitions and hackathons because writing code is what I do best.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I always stick to the principle, 'Assume nothing. If you feel it is true, find proof!' for my work life and in many other things too.
                </p>

                <h2>A LITTLE MORE ...</h2>

                <p>I like to read mystery stories and comic books sometimes. Tintin is my childhood favorite.</p>
                <p>I love craft beer and I like to collect glasses/souvenirs from breweries that I visit.</p>
                <p>I love photography. I will sometimes go to great lengths to get the best shot. If you are a photographer, talk to me on  <a href="http://instagram.com/gaurav.kshirsagar" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.</p>
                <p>I play soccer <strike>a lot</strike> sometimes and watch a lot of English Premier League and Champions League.</p>
                <p>Horror movies are something I enjoy (and spend a few sleepless nights after) watching. Presently, The Conjuring series is my favorite.</p>
                <p>I started tinkering with computers since I was in school. I plan to build my own workstaton/gaming station some day (when I have enough money for it).</p>
                <p>I play a <strike>lot</strike> little bit of computer/mobile games. Favorite titles: FIFA, COD, Hitman, Assassin's Creed, Clash of Clans.</p>
                <p>I dabble in playing my favorite songs on the keyboard.</p>
                <p>I do my bit to protect and conserve environment.</p>
